# portfolio-optimization
This project represents a short course in portfolio optimisation. This course is structured as followed: First the basics of optimisation and the necessary mathematical concepts are covered in a first section. In a second section the process of selecting assets given a model and its conditions is discussed. In the near future this course will be updated and will include the topics of portfolio management and index tracking.

## Getting started and prerequisites
The examples given in this course are made with the Jupyter-Notebook of the Anaconda Distribution using Python 3.x.x. In order to solve the mathematical problems this course uses the Gurobi solver for its conventional approach and intuitive utilisation.

 ### Installation of Gurobi
 As a student you can request a free academic license on their website: https://www.gurobi.com/. Once you filled out the registration you can download and install the latest version of the Gurobi sovler. After a restart of your computer log in with the account you created before and request a licence. Copy your licence-key and paste it into your command/terminal prompt.

### Installation of Anaconda
 Once your done with installing the Gurobi solver visit  https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ and download the Anaconda distribution for your system (this course is based on Python 3.7). After the installation process open up the Anaconda prompt and type: conda install -c gurobi gurobi.
